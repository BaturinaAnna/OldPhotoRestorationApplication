# Old Photo Restoration Application

Everyone has old photographs that are precious as memories, but that are preserved only on a small piece of paper. In addition, there are a large number of factors that can lead to the loss of these photos: improper storage and, as a result, fading from the sun, creases, printing on poor quality paper, as it was in the 90s, that also leads to fading and much more. There are also factors that were in the photo initially: uneven paper, which makes it difficult to perceive the photo, noise in the images and much more. So this app helps to keep these memories.

#### The app consists of 3 main parts:
 - An android part (this repository)
 - Neural Network to restore old photos (https://github.com/iddoroshenko/Bringing-Old-Photos-Back-to-Life)
 - Servlet to get old photo, run neural network and send its output to the android (https://github.com/BaturinaAnna/OldPhotoRestorationServlet/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/OldPhotoRestoration/RestorationServlet.java)
